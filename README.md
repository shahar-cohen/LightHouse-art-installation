# LightHouse â€” Interactive computer vision art installation

A lighthouse/watchtower that tracks people and shines a light on them.
The tower is a tall, thin, triangular pyramid, each side of which is a screen for projection-mapping our custom made visuals.

=============================================================================

This project assumes a system with 3 main parts:

1) A Raspberry pi connected to a servo motor controlling the tilt, a stepper motor + driver controlling the pan movement,
a camera and a flashlight.

The Raspberry pi must run the Pigpio daemon that enables controling it's i/o pins remotely and send the video over UDP by 
some software (such as VLC).

2) A projection mapping software

The software runs on the same computer as this program, and is connected to 3 projectors.
it receives instructions from this program and changes the image the projectors would project on the tower.
The software must have OSC communication enabled and set up with the same addresses as specified in the config file. 

3) This program.

This program receives images from the Raspberry pi and according to the images run one of two modes:
        DETECTION:
            *tell projection software (over OSC protocol message) to project lighthouse image on the tower.
            *move the camera/light on a constant speed to the right.
            *if a person found, save their location and switch to TRACKING mode
        TRACKING:
            *tell projection software to project eyes on the tower.
            *move camera/light in a way that the person would be in the center of the image.
            *if person lost/freeze occured, change to DETECTION mode.

Each of this program's features (pan movement, tilt movement, receiving images, detection/tracking, 
OSC communication) is run on a different thread.

=============================================================================

FILES:
Main.py - the main part of the program.
config.py - a file with constants that can be tweeked to change the behaviour of the installation.
util.py - a file containing static functions

two files pertaining to the object recognition model:
MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt
MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel

video files:
lighthouse_pannel_*_animation.mp4 - an animation representing a lighthouse for each pannel of the tower
watch_tower_animation.mp4 - an animation representing a watchtower

=============================================================================

Required python libraries:
cv2, imutils, numpy, threading, pythonosc, pigpio, socket, time, collections, copy.
